# **Pomodoro Clock Documentation**

## **Introduction**

The Pomodoro Clock is a time management tool that helps you stay focused and productive. It follows the Pomodoro Technique, where you work in focused intervals called "work time" and take short breaks in between. This web app, built using Vite and ReactJS, provides a user-friendly interface to manage your work and break durations.

*Please note that the current version of the app is not responsive, but updates are planned to make it responsive in the near future.*
